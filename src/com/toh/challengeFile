Practical Test
Subject: Tower of Hanoi
Programming Language: Java
Editor: Any 
 
Problem Description:
The candidate has to resolve "Tower of Hanoi" problem.
When a program runs, it should ask for  "Number of Towers" (at least 5 max 10) & "Number of Disks" (max 40)
The program should show each step in output. 
 
Evaluation Criteria:
OOPs concept (10%)
Coding standard (10%)
Problem-solving skill (80%)

The full requirements:
Must correctly solve the required motion without violating stacking rules (e.g. on each peg, no bigger disk sits on any smaller disk).
5 - 10 towers / pegs
3 - 40 disks

Not required but preferred:
Good software engineering practices (e.g. code formatting, variable names, comments / JavaDoc, unit tests)
Efficiency of moves (no unneeded moves)
Efficiency of code (time and space complexity)  At least be able to estimate general space/time complexity.
